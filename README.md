# Foodie-Cloud-Next-Gen-Online-Food-Delivery-Platform-Powered-using-AWS
# AWS Food Delivery üçîüöÄ  

AWS Food Delivery is a **cloud-native, serverless food ordering and delivery platform** built entirely on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. The project demonstrates how to design and deploy a fully scalable, cost-effective, and event-driven application using **modern serverless architecture** principles.  

It enables **users to browse menus, place orders, track them in real-time, and receive instant notifications** while restaurants can manage their offerings efficiently. By integrating **AWS Lambda**, **DynamoDB**, **API Gateway**, **Cognito**, and **SNS**, the project eliminates the need for traditional server management while ensuring **high availability, fault tolerance, and security**.  

This project serves as a **blueprint for developers, students, and cloud architects** to understand how to build production-ready applications using AWS services. From **user authentication to order management, notifications, and hosting**, everything runs seamlessly in the cloud with **pay-as-you-go pricing** and **auto-scaling capabilities**.

## üìú Project Overview  

The AWS Food Delivery project solves real-world challenges faced by traditional food delivery systems, such as:  
- **Scalability**: Easily handle thousands of users/orders without infrastructure headaches.  
- **Cost Optimization**: No servers to maintain, pay only for what you use.  
- **Faster Development**: Use managed AWS services to focus on business logic rather than infrastructure setup.  

With this platform, customers can:  
- Register/Login securely using **AWS Cognito**.  
- Browse restaurant menus stored in **DynamoDB**.  
- Place food orders via **API Gateway** integrated with **AWS Lambda**.  
- Track the status of their order in **real-time**.  
- Receive SMS/Email updates powered by **SNS/SES**.  
- Access the web app hosted on **Amazon S3** with optional CDN support via **CloudFront**.
